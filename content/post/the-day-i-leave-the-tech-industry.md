I was inspired last night by Cate Huston's post,
[The Day I Leave the Tech Industry](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2014/07/28/the-day-i-leave-the-tech-industry/).
I decided to write my own, except I'm not as eloquent a writer as Cate so before
I go any further please, please, please read her post and not mine.

Mine is going to be a bit different. Lately I've been thinking more and more
about this. It seems imminent. I'm only 27 and let me repeat: it seems imminent.

I'm going to tell you all the fantasy that plays in my brain for when this happens.

The day I leave the tech industry will feel like a giant weight has finally been
lifted. It will be freeing. There are a few scenarios I've played out for what
I will do after.

- teach math in a third world country
- write a book
- play professional poker

I could do all three. One thing is for sure though, the day I leave the tech industry
will be the day I contribute my last piece of code to open source software.

Today, I am not quite ready to give up this thing I have such a "hate/love"
relationship with. Today, I _want_ to get more women contributing so that
maybe in the distant future we will feel welcome. Maybe we won't have to fight
so hard just to be heard; to have _our_ opinions matter.

Today is **not** my last day in the tech industry. But it is comforting to me
to plan out this very real future. I am not just "the container girl". I am a
human being with feelings, a limit, and a future outside of tech.
